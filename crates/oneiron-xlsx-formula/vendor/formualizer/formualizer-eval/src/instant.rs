//! Portable timing abstraction for the evaluation engine.
//!
//! - Default / native / portable-wasm: wraps `std::time::Instant` (zero JS deps).
//! - `js-runtime` feature (browser WASM via wasm-bindgen): wraps `web_time::Instant`,
//!   which calls `performance.now()` in the browser where `std::time::Instant` panics.
//!
//! All engine code should use `FzInstant` rather than either concrete type directly.
