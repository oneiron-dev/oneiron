# Stemma fork provenance (ONE-2522)

The source under `vendor/stemma-engine` and `vendor/stemma-diff` was copied from
[stemma-sh/stemma](https://github.com/stemma-sh/stemma), commit
`ad1e70deac0a828d5162ac3b3f2186c2bb0c075e` (2026-09-26 snapshot).
The upstream work is dual-licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0. We elect Apache-2.0;
the original `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT` are retained here and in both
upstream crate roots, along with original source headers and attribution.

Changes from that commit: no edits to upstream `src/` or fixtures. We omit its
MCP, API server, CLI, and session runtimes (these are separate upstream crates).
The `oneiron-docedit` wrapper adds a stateless caller-facing Word revision
entry and blocking export-linker check. The upstream engine's `runtime.rs`
remains because its stateless serialization helpers and error types back the
pure `api::Document` facade; the wrapper does not expose a session store.
Stemma's tests and fixture bytes are copied without modification so the
conformance baseline remains runnable. Upstream packages are not separately
published by this workspace.
