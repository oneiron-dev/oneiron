# Migration Notes

## M0-1 / ONE-1078: EdgeKind discriminant order

`EdgeKind` u8 values now match the pinned ARCH-0034 `edgeKinds` order. This
changes the persisted edge-kind byte in `edges_out` and `edges_in` LMDB keys,
as well as EdgeRef/CRDT edge-key encodings.

Existing vaults written with the pre-M0-1 order must not be read as-is under
the new order. They need the schema-version migration planned for M0-4
(ONE-1081). This change intentionally adds no migration tooling; the engine is
pre-launch and no production vaults are expected.

## M0-2 / ONE-1079: Selective edge value layouts

Edge VALUE bytes are no longer a uniform 24-byte buffer. ARCH-0034 now writes
edge values by layout class: structural edges are 12 B, semantic-bare edges are
24 B, and semantic-provenanced edges are 26 B. This is another edge ABI change
on top of M0-1. Existing vaults must fail closed under the open-time gate
planned for M0-4 (ONE-1081); no migration tooling is added here.
